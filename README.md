# ui_testing

This project is for internal need but if you can get some use out of it, you are welcome to participate.  
The purpose of this project is to automate testing using a JSON test file that defines test steps.  
Once the tests are done, generate a results document.

It uses selenium web driver and assumes you have it installed and in the environment paths.
